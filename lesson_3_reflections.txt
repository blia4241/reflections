When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

>When you work on multiple stations, or when different people upload their progresses to the same project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>Not possible to edit via Git every single time. Should allow changes done locally to be "uploaded" as to promote efficiency.
